All members are required to install Ubuntu Jammy to ensure that everyone is working on the same operating system, thereby minimizing potential compatibility issues. 
MuJoCo: Physics Simulation
We will examine the predefined Go1 XML file from the MuJoCo documentation and incorporate its structural framework into our current model.

### Gymnasium: Machine Learning Platform 
We will study the UC Berkeley lectures on deep reinforcement learning to gain a comprehensive understanding of how the model operates and how it can be applied to the quadruped robot. 
Blender and 3D Design
 
### Git and GitHub
All team members will sign up for GitHub and be added as collaborators on the Quadruped Robot repository. Additionally, everyone will learn the necessary commands to effectively use GitHub on their computers.
